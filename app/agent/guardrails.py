"""Checks run on every sentence before it is released to be spoken.

Guardrail 2, tool-only figures: every number in a reply must have come from a tool
result in this call. The agent is told to write figures in digits (TTS turns them into
words), so the check reads digits in any of the four numeral systems, and rejects
magnitude words such as "thousand" or "लाख" that would let a figure slip past as words.

Known limits, to be covered by the [kn] and [bn] tasks and by the evals:
- Small numbers written as words ("five", "पाँच") are not caught.
- Magnitude words are listed for English and Hindi/Hinglish only.
- A figure the caller said is not allowed until a tool has returned it.
